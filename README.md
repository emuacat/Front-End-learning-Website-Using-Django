## Project Overview

This application is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for learners to browse, search for, and enroll in their preferred courses. A key feature is the built-in search functionality that makes it easier for users to find the courses they are interested in.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Deployment Platform**: AWS Fargate

## Deployment on AWS Fargate

This Django application is deployed using AWS Fargate. Fargate makes it easy for me to focus on building my applications, as it removes the need to provision and manage servers. I have used various AWS EC2 resources such as VPC, subnets, and security groups to run a custom AWS instance.
